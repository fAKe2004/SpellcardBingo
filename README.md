## Game Rules

Two teams compete to gain higher scores, where each team member can challenge a limited number of spellcards. (Two teams may challenge and acquire same spellcard.)

Spellcards are classified into different difficulty levels and assigned scores accordingly. Each bingo (row, column, diagonal) grants a bonus.

For a recording example, watch [this video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1gQ2rBQEDC/?t=2610) (starts at ~43:30).

## Deployment

### Quick start

Requirements:
- Python 3.10+
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Data file: `data/SpellcardData.csv`

Run the server:

```bash
python app.py           # start fresh (new random board)
python app.py --resume  # resume from the latest checkpoint if available
```

Open http://localhost:5000 in a browser. The page is optimized for on-stage display.

### Top HUD UI

- Left and right: team titles “RED” and “BLUE”.
- Center row labels: “score” and “hp”.
- Under each team title you’ll see the team’s total score and its HP controls.

### Selecting a team

Use the “select” button below a team label to make that team active. The active team’s button shows “selected”. All clicks on the grid affect the currently selected team only.

### Clicking cells (core logic)

For the currently selected team, cell clicks cycle through these states:

1. Unchecked → Pending
2. Pending → Checked
3. Checked → Unchecked

- A team can have at most one Pending cell at a time. Clicking an Unchecked cell when the team already has a Pending cell will move the Pending marker to the new cell.

### Adjusting HP

- Each team has per-cell HP controls “- hp +” under the HUD.
- HP is tied to that team’s current Pending cell:
	- When a team has a Pending cell, its HP value appears and the “-”/“+” buttons are enabled.
	- If the team has no Pending cell, HP shows “--” and the buttons are disabled.

### Resetting the game

Click “Reset” to reinitialize everything.

### Scoring

- Per‑cell scores come from the data file and are shown in the bottom‑right of each cell.
- Team totals are calculated on the server (see `calc.py`) from the sum of checked cells and bingo bonus.

### Persistence and resume

- On startup, the server will start fresh by default. Use `--resume` to restore from the latest available checkpoint.
- On shutdown, the server saves a checkpoint containing board layout, per‑team cell states, and HP.
- Checkpoints are written as pickle files to `data/checkpoint-{id}.pickle` and the latest is loaded when resuming.

## Configurable Settings

> defs.py

1. `N`: size of the grid
2. `max_hp`: per spellcard+team HP
3. `privileged_spellcard_ids`: special spellcards that are guaranteed to sample.
4. `show_reset_btn`: whether to show the Reset button on the frontend (hide to avoid accidental clicks).

> calc.py
1. `def line_score(line_values: List[int]) -> int`: how bingo bonus is calculated.

## UI details

- Cell name rendering: two-line clamp with a display-width heuristic (ASCII ≈ 1 unit, CJK ≈ 2 units) to keep names readable within 72×72 cells.
- Comment rendering: font size adapts heuristically based on length so most comments fit within a ~28px tall area below the name; color flips to white when the cell is checked for contrast.
- Pending state outline: visible border in the active team color, extending slightly outside the cell box for stage visibility.
- Score: circled numerals at bottom-right for scores up to 20; larger scores fall back to plain text.
- Layout: the “select” buttons are aligned directly below their respective team columns; the center column keeps a fixed width so alignment remains stable whether the Reset button is visible or hidden.
